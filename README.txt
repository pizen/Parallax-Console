This code was written initially to correctly display the console output of
the DEFCON 20 Human badge, a Parallax Propellor based electronic badge.
I was unable to locate an existing tool for OSX that would correctly display
the output. Neither screen nor the BST serial console were fully compatible
and all had formating or character issues.

As the original intent was to read from the DC20 badge this is currently a
read-only serial console.
